            <h3>Release 18th December 2018 (version 1.2)</h3>

            ProteoRE now comprises 15 tools for:
            <ul>
                <li>Data manipulation (e.g. filtering, list comparison, ID conversion)</li>
                <li>Human annotation (protein features, MS/MS observations, expression and tissue-specificity)</li>
                <li>GO terms analysis (functional profiles, enrichment analysis)</li>
                <li>Pathways analysis (Reactome and KEGG pathways exploration)</li>
                <li>Graphical representation (Venn diagram, heat map, bar- and dot-plotâ€¦)  </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Release 19th September 2018 (version 1.1)</h3>

            Updates: 
            <ul>
                <li>Filter by keywords or numerical value: You can now filter by a range of values, choose an operator to use when multiple filters are set (AND or OR) and sort your result files</li>
                <li>ID converter: the Mus musculus species is now available for id conversion, update of reference mapping file for id conversion, from Uniprot and neXtProt files (12/09/18)</li>
                <li>goProfiles: Mus musculus is now available as reference species, packages updated, IDs format is now checked. </li>
            </ul>

            New tools:
            <ul>
                <li>Number of MS/MS observations in a tissue : this tool reports the number of times peptides matching a protein have been observed in a given human biological sample using LC-MS/MS proteomics approach. Data were queried from Peptide Atlas release (Jan 2018). </li>
                <li>KEGG pathways coverage : this tool reports pathways concern by the proteins entered. Pathways are found with the Keggrest R library, results are sorted by the number of mapping ids on the number of pathway genes (%). </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Release 7th May 2018 (version 1.0)</h3>

            ProteoRE comprises tools for:
            <ul>
                <li>Standard data manipulation (e.g. filtering, sorting, and ranking)Protein list annotation</li>
                <li>Annotation retrieval from databases</li>
                <li>Functional and pathways analysis (cross-comparison, classification and enrichment analysis)</li>
                <li>Graphical representation      </li>
            </ul>
